# KT-geolocation-classification-of-tweets
COMP90049 Knowledge Technology: geolocation classification of tweets



project 2 of KT:
To build a geolocation classier for Twitter users, based on their Tweets
(and possibly other meta-data you might have about the user). That is, given a tweet associated to a specic
user, your system will produce a prediction of where that user is located. For this project, we will limit the
set of relevant locations (target classes) to the following ve United States cities that are well{represented
in the dataset: Boston (B), Houston (H), San Diego (SD), Seattle (Se), and Washington DC (W).
